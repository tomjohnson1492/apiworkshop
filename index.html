<p>This is a simple index file that appears when you go to the homepage of the API Workshop repository (<a href="https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/apiworkshop" target="_blank">https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/apiworkshop</a>). I set up Github Pages with this repository, so you can view any file in the repository by simply adding the correct path in the URL. </p>

<p>For example, to view the eventbrite.html file in the repository, go to <a href="https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/apiworkshop/eventbrite.html">https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/apiworkshop/eventbrite.html</a>. That's it.</p>
